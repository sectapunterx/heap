// turns one block's inline tree into that subset, and it is the only place
// that emits markup — everything else in the engine works on the AST.
//
// Two rules hold throughout. Every piece of document text is escaped, so a
// note containing "<script>" shows those characters rather than becoming
// markup: raw HTML in a note is displayed, never executed. And no tag is
// emitted that would make Qt fetch something over the network; see
// `allowRemoteImages`.

// Colours come from the QML theme rather than being baked in, so the rendered
// view matches the editor in both light and dark mode.
