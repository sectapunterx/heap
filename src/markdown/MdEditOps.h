// Markdown editing operations, as functions over a QTextDocument.
//
// These used to live as JavaScript inside NotesView.qml, where they could
// only be exercised by driving the UI. They are the kind of code that is all
// edge cases — what Enter does on an empty list item, what Tab does inside a
// fence, what bold does when the selection already is bold — so they belong
// somewhere a test can call them directly.
//
// Every op goes through a QTextCursor inside one edit block, which makes it
// one undo step. That is not a detail: an operation that lands as two steps
// leaves a half-applied state behind after Ctrl+Z, and the reader has no way
// to tell what happened.

// Where the caret and selection are, before and after an operation. Positions
// are UTF-16, the unit QTextDocument and Qt Quick's text items count in.

// do its ordinary thing.
