// heap's sound palette (APP-177; the single completion tick was APP-167): three
// low, muffled sounds for three events — a task closed, an undo, a refused
// action — and three short chimes as a meeting comes closer (APP-178, see
// src/cal/MeetingChimes.h). Never for navigation, typing, switching views or
// hovering. Off by default; one switch and a volume in Settings → Appearance →
// Sound. Quiet hours, focus mode and the system's busy states (Windows:
// presentation, full screen) keep them silent. No QtMultimedia — each platform plays the bundled
// WAV with what it already has:
//   Windows → PlaySoundW(SND_MEMORY | SND_ASYNC) from winmm.
//   macOS   → NSSound.
//   Linux   → a detached `paplay` (or `aplay -q`) on a cached copy of the file;
//             silent when neither is installed.
// The WAVs are made by tools/gen_sounds.py.
